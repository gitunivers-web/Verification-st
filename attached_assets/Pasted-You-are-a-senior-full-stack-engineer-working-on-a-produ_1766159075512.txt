You are a senior full-stack engineer working on a production web application.
Your task is to implement the following fixes and improvements with maximum rigor, clean code, and zero regressions.
All changes must be production-ready, tested, and documented where necessary.
Do not implement partial solutions. Do not leave TODOs.

1. Authentication – Forgot Password
- Add a fully functional "Forgot Password" feature.
- The feature must work in production (email token, secure expiration, reset flow).
- All texts must be fully multilingual and integrated with the existing i18n system.

2. Mobile Navigation Behavior
- Fix the mobile menu behavior.
- When a menu item is clicked, the menu must automatically close after navigation.
- Ensure consistent behavior across all mobile breakpoints.

3. Popup Messages – Content & Localization
- Replace all generic popup messages (e.g. "Error 404", default system errors) with clear, user-friendly, context-aware messages.
- Internationalize all popups so they adapt dynamically to the current site language.

4. Emails Localization
- All emails sent to users must be multilingual.
- The email language must match the user’s selected or detected language.
- No email should be sent in French by default unless the user language is French.

5. Language & IP Detection
- Implement automatic detection of the user’s country via IP address.
- Automatically select the corresponding site language if supported.
- If the detected country language is not supported, default to English.
- Ensure the user can still manually change language at any time.

6. Dashboard Refresh Button
- Fix the dashboard refresh button, which is currently inactive.
- Ensure it correctly reloads data without full page reload if possible.

7. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Implement 2FA for both Admin and User accounts.
- Use industry-standard methods (e.g. TOTP, email, or authenticator apps).
- Ensure secure enrollment, verification, recovery, and disabling flows.

8. Admin Mobile Notifications
- In the Admin mobile view, notification banners for incoming requests currently appear at the bottom of the screen.
- Move these notifications to the top of the Admin interface.
- Ensure they are clearly visible and non-intrusive.

9. NOVA_AI_ENGINE Counters Synchronization
- Ensure NOVA_AI_ENGINE counters display identically on desktop and mobile:
  - Codes analyzed
  - Frauds detected
  - Codes verified per day
- Counters must be perfectly synchronized across devices and sessions.
- New users must see accurate real-time data immediately after registration.

10. Post-Registration Redirection
- After successful account creation and email validation, automatically redirect the user to the dashboard.
- Do not leave the user on a confirmation or intermediate screen.

11. WebSocket Event Coverage
- Ensure WebSocket connections cover all relevant events:
  - Automatic updates when a verification is performed on the site
  - Real-time propagation of admin actions to user dashboards
- Guarantee reliability, reconnection handling, and event consistency.

General Requirements:
- Follow best security practices.
- Ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
- Test all changes on both desktop and mobile.
- Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality.
